# zipfModeling
- ZipfModeling is an expertise model to identify expert developers based on how they write code. <br />
- With "Tokenizer", you can tokenize the content of python code into the AST nodes of source code. <br />
- With "ZipfModeling_syn", you can fit a probability distribution with Zipf's law.<br />
- We generate a labeled synthetic dataset by resampling real data. This dataset contains 1200 developers in two categories of "Expert" and "Novice". With this data you can explore the validity of expertise models based on the content of programming code. <br />
- A part of dataset exist in "Dataset" contains the content of source files before and after applying a commit by developer. The 3 GB collected data is not uploaded here due to space. Please contact us if you need the whole dataset.
